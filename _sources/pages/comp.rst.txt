WSL Surf Fantasy Competition
=============================

Summary
--------
The world surf league is the governing body of "The World Championship Tour" or "CT" which is a surfing competition for the worlds best. To be on the CT the (male) surfers can (1) qualify on the World Qualifying Series (WQS; top 10), (2) already be on tour and perform reasonably well the year before (top 22), or (3) be a wildcard (2 surfers). There are differences in the womans World Championship Tour which need to be considered in the data collection and transformation steps.
